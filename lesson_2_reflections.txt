What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository creates the git file.  I need to initialize so I can 
begin saving commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows me to separate out the files that I want to include in 
one commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change?

I can only add one file that I've changed, and then add others as 
separate commits.
